\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame or data.table containing social media data. Must include columns for post IDs, account IDs, timestamps, and content.}

\item{vector_matrix}{A matrix of embeddings where columns are embedding dimensions and rows are documents, with rownames() indicating the post IDs. Default is NULL.}

\item{time_window}{An integer specifying the time window (in seconds) within which to detect similar posts. Default is 60.}

\item{min_simil}{A numeric value specifying the minimum cosine similarity threshold to consider posts as similar. Default is 0.9.}

\item{min_participation}{An integer specifying the minimum number of participations required to consider an account as part of coordinated activity. Default is 3.}

\item{post_id}{Optional column name for post IDs if not named 'post_id' in `data`.}

\item{account_id}{Optional column name for account IDs if not named 'account_id' in `data`.}

\item{time}{Optional column name for timestamps if not named 'time' in `data`.}

\item{content}{Optional column name for content if not named 'content' in `data`.}

\item{verbose}{A logical value indicating whether to display progress messages. Default is TRUE.}

\item{method}{A character string specifying the similarity method to use. Default is "cosine".}

\item{remove_loops}{A logical value indicating whether to remove loops (self-similar posts from the same account). Default is TRUE.}

\item{parallel}{A logical value indicating whether tbb for parallel processing should be used. Also see set_num_threads.}
}
\value{
A data.table containing pairs of similar posts along with their account IDs and similarity scores.
}
\description{
This function detects highly similar social media content shared within a specified time window,
aiming to capture coordinated social media manipulation. It uses embeddings to calculate the 
cosine similarity between posts.
