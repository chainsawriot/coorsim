\arguments{
\item{python_version}{Character. The Python version to install in the Conda environment.
Defaults to `"3.13:latest"`.}

\item{conda_path}{Character. The path where Miniconda should be installed.
If `NULL`, Miniconda is installed in the default location.}

\item{conda_env_path}{Character. The path where the Conda environment should be created.
If `NULL`, the environment is created in the default Conda environments directory.}

\item{conda_env_name}{Character. The name of the Conda environment to create or use.
Defaults to `"conda-coorsim"`.}

\item{ask}{Logical. If `TRUE`, prompts the user for confirmation before installing Miniconda.
Defaults to `TRUE`.}

\item{force}{Logical. If `TRUE`, forces reinstallation even if an environment exists.
Defaults to `FALSE`.}

\description{
Installs Miniconda if no suitable Conda installation is found and 
creates a specified Conda environment with the given Python version. 
Optionally allows specifying the Miniconda installation path and the Conda environment location.
}
\details{
The function:
\itemize{
  \item Checks if a valid Conda installation exists.
  \item Prompts the user to install Miniconda if no Conda installation is found.
  \item Creates a Conda environment at the specified location.
  \item Activates the created Conda environment.
}

If `conda_path` is specified, Miniconda is installed at that location. If 
`conda_env_path` is provided, the Conda environment is created there. 
The function ensures that Conda is properly set up before proceeding.
