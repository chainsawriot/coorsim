\title{Z-score Standardization}
\usage{
z_standardize(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector to be standardized. Missing values (NA) will be ignored in the calculation.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the same length as `x`, where each value is standardized to have a mean of 0 
and a standard deviation of 1. Any missing values (NA) in `x` are preserved.
}
\description{
This function performs Z-score standardization (also called normalization) on a numeric vector. 
It scales the input data so that it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
}
\details{
The function calculates the mean and standard deviation of the input vector, ignoring any 
missing values (`NA`). It then subtracts the mean from each value and divides the result by the standard deviation.

# Example usage
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
z_standardize(x)
