\title{Query Embeddings and Compute Cosine Similarities}
\usage{
query_and_compute_similarities(m, post_id_lists, threshold)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{A NumericMatrix containing the embedding data with row names representing post IDs.}

\item{post_id_lists}{A List of CharacterVector objects, where each CharacterVector represents a set of post IDs to query in the embedding matrix.}

\item{threshold}{A double value representing the threshold for cosine similarity. Only similarities above this threshold are included in the output.}
}
\value{
A List of DataFrames. Each data frame contains three columns: "post_id" (the first post ID in the pair), "post_id_y" (the second post ID in the pair), and "similarity" (the cosine similarity between them).
}
\description{
This function takes a numeric matrix containing embeddings and a list of post ID lists. 
It performs two tasks sequentially to conserve memory:
1. Queries the embeddings for each post ID list.
2. Computes the cosine similarities between the first embedding and all other embeddings within each subset.
}
\details{
The function returns a list of data frames where each data frame contains post ID pairs and their cosine similarities that exceed the given threshold.
}
