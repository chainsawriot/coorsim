\usage{
install_conda_coorsim(
  python_version = "3.13",
  conda_path = NULL,
  conda_env_path = NULL,
  conda_env_name = "conda-coorsim",
  ask = TRUE,
  force = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{python_version}{Character. The Python version to install in the Conda environment.
Defaults to `"3.13:latest"`.}

\item{conda_path}{Character. The path where Miniconda should be installed.
If `NULL`, Miniconda is installed in the default location.}

\item{conda_env_path}{Character. The path where the Conda environment should be created.
If `NULL`, the environment is created in the default Conda environments directory.}

\item{conda_env_name}{Character. The name of the Conda environment to create or use.
Defaults to `"conda-coorsim"`.}

\item{ask}{Logical. If `TRUE`, prompts the user for confirmation before installing Miniconda.
Defaults to `TRUE`.}

\item{force}{Logical. If `TRUE`, forces reinstallation of dependencies even if they are already installed.
Defaults to `FALSE`.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If `TRUE`, prints progress messages.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns `NULL`. The function is executed for its side effects
of installing and configuring Conda and dependencies.
}
\description{
Installs Miniconda if necessary, creates a Conda environment, 
and installs PyTorch and Transformers within the specified environment.
This function serves as a high-level wrapper that ensures all dependencies 
are correctly set up.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\itemize{
  \item Ensures that Miniconda is installed at the specified location (or the default).
  \item Creates a Conda environment at the given `conda_env_path`, if specified.
  \item Installs PyTorch in the Conda environment, choosing the appropriate CPU or GPU build.
  \item Installs the `transformers` package if it is not already installed.
}

If `conda_path` is specified, Miniconda is installed at that location. If 
`conda_env_path` is provided, the Conda environment is created there. 
This wrapper ensures a fully configured environment for use with Coorsim.
