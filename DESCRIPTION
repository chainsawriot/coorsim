Description: R package for detection of Coordinated Social Media Manipulation (CSMM). 
    Detects sharing of highly similar content within short time windows, drawing on cosine similarity of content embeddings. 
    Implements the Focal Structure Algorithm Variant of Weber & Neumann (2021) to identify highly coordinated clusters of accounts. 
    Provides functions to plot and analyze coordinated networks, accounts, and content. 
    Co-Similarity compuation is C++ based and parallelized. Efficient data-wrangling is warranted by data.table.
